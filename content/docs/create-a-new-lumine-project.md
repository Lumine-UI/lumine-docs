# Create a new Lumine project

To get started with a new Lumine project, you can use the following command:

```bash
npx create-lumine-app my-app
```

This will create a new Lumine project based on React Native with all the required dependencies in the `my-app` directory.

## Adding Lumine to an existing project

If you already have a React Native project, you can add Lumine to it by running the following command:

```bash
npm install @lumine-ui/core
```
