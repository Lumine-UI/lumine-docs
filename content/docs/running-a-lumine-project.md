# Running a Lumine Project

Once you have created a Lumine project, you can run the following command to start the project

```sh
cd <app_name>
npm start
```

This will start the development server and open the app in the browser or device.

## Running on a particular platform

You can run the following command to start the project on a particular platform:

```sh
npm run android
npm run ios
npm run web
```

## Result

This will start a react-native (expo) counter app.
